# Palindrome-Checker
The Palindrome Checker is a simple yet functional web application that checks whether an input string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. This project, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers a quick way to test strings while showcasing fundamental programming concepts.
