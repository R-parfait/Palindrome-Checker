# Palindrome-Checker

## Description:
The Palindrome Checker is a simple yet functional web application that checks whether an input string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). This project, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers a quick way to test strings while showcasing fundamental programming concepts.

## Features:
Real-Time Palindrome Detection: Instantly determines if the user input is a palindrome.
Case-Insensitive and Flexible: Ignores case, spaces, and special characters for accurate results.
Interactive Interface: Clean and user-friendly design to enhance usability.
Reset Option: Easily clear input and try again.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML: Provides the structure for input fields and results display.
- CSS: Styles the application for a visually appealing and responsive design.
- JavaScript: Handles palindrome logic and dynamic updates.

## Significance

This project highlights:
- Programming Logic: Demonstrates string manipulation and conditional checks.
- Frontend Development: Displays your ability to build interactive web applications.
- Attention to Detail: Shows proficiency in handling edge cases like spaces, punctuation, and case insensitivity.
